## About this project
This was my **final year university project (2022)**.  

# TestFileGenerator – Final Year Project

If it is your first time running the program as a tester, you will need a user created for yourself to be authenticated to use the program.  

To do this, run the `change_tester.bat` file in the `dist` folder, which will create a user for you in the program.

To then run the program, use `RUN.bat` in the `dist` folder.  
Ensure that 64-bit Java is installed on your machine and the program should automatically launch via the batch file.

⚠️ An `.exe` was not able to be generated due to complications with Java and the various libraries used.  
Instead, the batch file runs the program directly.
