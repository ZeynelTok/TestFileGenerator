# TestFileGenerator Created for Final Project

If it is your first time running the program as a tester, you will need a user created for yourself to be authenticated to use the program, to do this, run the change_tester.bat file in the dist folder, this will create a user for you in the program.

To then run the program, use RUN.bat in the dist folder. Ensure that 64 bit java is installed on your machine and the program should automatically launch via the batch file

An exe was not able to be generated due to complications with Java and the various other libraries used. The Exe generated had issues running and confirming the presence of the java dependencies, so created a batch file which essentially runs the program.
